# 2R-3R-PlanarManipulatorIK-DNN
Tutorial resource using neural nets to learn the inverse kinematics function of 2R and 3R planar manipulators. Implementations in both PyTorch and Tensorflow. Rendered in PyGame.

Two example trajectories are included for each the 2R manipulator and 3R manipulator.

Requires PyTorch [or TensorFlow], NumPy, and PyGame.

**Note: Not intended to be used with PyTorch and TensorFlow both installed in the same environment.**
